- **Streamlined Code Reviews**: Decreases review overhead by ensuring consistent patterns in submissions
- **Standards Compliance**: Assists in maintaining adherence to project conventions and requirements

## Cursor Rules Organization

AIQ Toolkit offers a comprehensive collection of Cursor rules organized into four primary categories:

- **[Foundation Rules](../reference/cursor-rules-reference.md#foundation-rules)**: Core code quality standards and cursor rules management
- **[Setup and Installation Rules](../reference/cursor-rules-reference.md#setup-and-installation-rules)**: Environment configuration and toolkit installation procedures
- **[CLI Command Rules](../reference/cursor-rules-reference.md#cli-command-rules)**: Complete AIQ CLI operations and command handling
- **[Workflow Development Rules](../reference/cursor-rules-reference.md#workflow-development-rules)**: Function and tool development for workflow creation

For a **comprehensive overview of all supported tasks**, including detailed prompts, examples, and capabilities for each rule, see the **[Cursor Rules Reference](../reference/cursor-rules-reference.md)**.

## Getting Started with Common Prompts

:::{note}
For optimal Cursor rules experience, avoid using the `Auto` mode for LLM model selection. Instead, manually choose a model from the selection menu, such as `claude-4-sonnet`.
:::

Here are frequently used prompts to begin your development:

**Installing AIQ Toolkit:**
```
Install AIQ Toolkit with all dependencies and verify the installation is working correctly.
```

**Environment setup:**
```
Help me set up AIQ Toolkit development environment with all required dependencies and configurations.
```

**Workflow creation:**
```
Create a workflow named demo_workflow in examples directory with description "Demo workflow for testing features".
```

**Function integration:**
```
Add a text processing function to my workflow that splits text into sentences and counts words.
```

**Running and serving workflows:**
```
Run my workflow locally for testing and then serve it as an API endpoint on port 8080.
```

For complete documentation with all available rules, prompts, and examples, refer to the **[Cursor Rules Reference](../reference/cursor-rules-reference.md)**.

## Practical Example: Building a Demo Agent with Cursor Rules

This comprehensive example demonstrates creating and running a functional agent workflow using Cursor rules:

### Step 1: Install AIQ Toolkit

Prompt:
```
Install AIQ Toolkit with all required dependencies and verify the installation
```

The assistant will reference and apply the [aiq-setup/aiq-toolkit-installation](../../../.cursor/rules/aiq-setup/aiq-toolkit-installation.mdc) rule to validate prerequisites and install the toolkit, followed by installation verification.

</div>

### Step 2: Explore Available Tools

Prompt:
```
Find datetime-related functions and tools available in AIQ Toolkit
```
The assistant will reference and apply the [aiq-cli/aiq-info](../../../.cursor/rules/aiq-cli/aiq-info.mdc) rule to discover available tools and functions.

<div align="center">
  <img src="../_static/cursor_rules_demo/find_tool.gif" width="600">
</div>


### Step 3: Create the Workflow

Prompt:
```
Create a new workflow named `demo_workflow` in the examples folder
```

The assistant will reference and apply the [aiq-workflows/general](../../../.cursor/rules/aiq-workflows/general.mdc) rule to generate a new workflow using the `aiq workflow create` command.

<div align="center">
  <img src="../_static/cursor_rules_demo/create_workflow.gif" width="600">
</div>

### Step 4: Configure DateTime Function

Prompt:
```
Add the current_datetime function to the demo_workflow
```

The assistant will reference and apply the [aiq-workflows/add-functions](../../../.cursor/rules/aiq-workflows/add-functions.mdc) rule to integrate the function into the workflow.

</div>


### Step 5: Integrate React Agent

Prompt:
```
Integrate ReAct agent to the workflow
```
The assistant will reference and apply the [aiq-agents/general](../../../.cursor/rules/aiq-agents/general.mdc) rule to integrate a ReAct agent within the workflow.

<div align="center">
  <img src="../_static/cursor_rules_demo/react_agent.gif" width="600">
</div>

### Step 6: Execute the Workflow

Prompt:
```
Run the demo_workflow
```

The assistant will reference and apply the [aiq-cli/aiq-run-serve](../../../.cursor/rules/aiq-cli/aiq-run-serve.mdc) rule to run the workflow.

<div align="center">
  <img src="../_static/cursor_rules_demo/run_workflow.gif" width="600">
</div>

Congratulations! You have successfully created a functional demo workflow using Cursor rules with minimal manual coding!

:::{note}
Keep your prompts specific and concise. For instance, rather than stating "Create a workflow", specify "Create a workflow named `demo_workflow` in examples directory with description `Demo workflow for testing features`".

## Summary

Cursor rules in AIQ Toolkit offer a powerful approach to streamline development processes, ensure consistency, and maintain superior code quality. By leveraging these guidelines and applying the appropriate rules for each development task, you can substantially enhance your development efficiency while creating robust, maintainable AIQ workflows.
