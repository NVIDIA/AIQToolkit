# General Rules for AIQ CLI commands

- For requests related to AIQ CLI commands, provide detailed information using the relevant sections from the [cli.md](mdc:docs/source/reference/cli.md) documen Encourage users to review the documentation themselves for a deeper understanding.

- If CLI commands do not function as expected, refer back to [cli.md](mdc:docs/source/reference/cli.md) and update any discrepancies in ts, as the documentation may have been updated without corresponding changes to the rules.
