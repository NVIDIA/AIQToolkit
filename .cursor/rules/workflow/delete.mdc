# Workflow Deletion Rules
Rules for deleting workflows from the AIQ system. These rules ensure proper workflow removal and cleanup.

## Command Pattern
Recognize workflow deletion requests and extract parameters:
1. Match patterns like:
   - 'delete workflow <name>'
   - 'remove workflow <name>'
   - 'uninstall workflow <name>'

## Deletion Process
When deleting a workflow:
1. Extract workflow name from request
2. Execute deletion command:
   ```bash
   yes | aiq workflow delete <workflow_name>
   ```
3. Verify deletion:
   - Run: `aiq info components -t package`
   - Confirm workflow no longer appears in installed components

## Parameter Validation
1. Validate workflow name:
   - Must be valid Python package name
   - Must exist in installed components
   - No spaces or special characters

## Error Handling
Handle workflow deletion errors and provide clear error messages:
1. Handle common errors:
   - Workflow not found
   - Permission denied
   - Dependencies preventing deletion
2. Provide clear error messages
3. Suggest corrections when possible
