# Workflow Deletion Rules

## Overview
Rules for deleting workflows from the AIQ system. These rules ensure proper workflow removal and cleanup.

## Command Structure
```bash
yes | aiq workflow delete <workflow_name>
```

### Required Parameters
- `workflow_name`: Name of the workflow to delete
  - Must be valid Python package name
  - Must exist in installed components
  - No spaces or special characters

## Natural Language Processing
- Match patterns like:
  - 'delete workflow <name>'
  - 'remove workflow <name>'
  - 'uninstall workflow <name>'

## Deletion Process
1. Extract workflow name from request
2. Execute deletion command with extracted parameters
3. Verify deletion:
   - Run: `aiq info components -t package`
   - Confirm workflow no longer appears in installed components

## Error Handling
1. Common errors to handle:
   - Workflow not found
   - Permission denied
   - Dependencies preventing deletion
2. Provide clear error messages
3. Suggest corrections when possible
