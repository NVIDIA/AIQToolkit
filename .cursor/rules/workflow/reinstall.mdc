2. Execute reinstallation command:
   ```bash
   aiq workflow reinstall <workflow_name>
   ```
3. Verify reinstallation:
   - Run: `aiq info components -t package`
   - Confirm workflow appears in installed components

## Parameter Validation
1. Validate workflow name:
   - Must be valid Python package name

   - No spaces or special characters

## Error Handling
Handle workflow reinstallation errors and provide clear error messages:
